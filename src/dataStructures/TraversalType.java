/**
 * Common data structure traversal type interface. Declared solely for the
 * purpose of extensibility.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Data structures provide their own traversal type ENUM type definitions
 * for use with traversers, but this allows programmers to override and
 * define their own traversal types.
 * </p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> When implementing new traversal type enums
 * <ol>
 * <li>The underlying data structure's traverser's
 * {@link java.util.Traverser#hasNext() hasNext()} and
 * {@link java.util.Traverser#next() next()} methods <i>must</i> be
 * overridden to extend or replace the traversal types.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example Usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>public enum MatrixMazeTraversalType implements TraversalType {
 *      UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT;
 * }</code>
 * </pre>
 * </p>
