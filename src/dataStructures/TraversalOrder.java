/**
 * Common data structure traversal order interface. Declared solely for the
 * purpose of extensibility.
 * 
 * <p>
 * Data structures provide their own traversal order ENUM type definitions
 * for use with iterators, but this allows programmers to override and
 * define their own traversal types.
 * </p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> When implementing new traversal order enums
 * <ol>
 * <li>The underlying data structure's iterator's
 * {@link java.util.Iterator#hasNext() hasNext()} and
 * {@link java.util.Iterator#next() next()} methods <i>must</i> be
 * overridden to extend or replace the traversal order types.</li>
 * <li>Although not a requirement, new traversal order enums should by
 * convention include a static {@code defaultOrder()} method.</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Example Usage:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * <code>public enum MazeTraversalOrder implements TraversalOrder {
 *      // Always make right turns in a maze to find exit
 *      RIGHT_TURN,
 *      
 *      // Always make left turns in a maze to find exit
 *      LEFT_TURN;
 *      
 *      // Returns default maze traversal.
 *      public static TraversalOrder defaultOrder() {
 *          return MazeTraversalOrder.RIGHT_TURN;
 *      }
 * }</code>
 * </pre>
 * </p>
